# Git hooks

This folder contains git hooks useful for development. These hooks must be installed by the developer
by linking them to the .git/hooks folder. 

Symbolic links can be created on Unix platforms (run in the root of the project) with command: 

'ln -s $(pwd)/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks'
